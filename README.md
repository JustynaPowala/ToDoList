# Introduction
ToDoList is ASP.NET Core application, built in client-server architecture. It allows you to create your own lists with tasks to do. The technologies I used are ASP.NET Core, Blazor & EF.

# How to run the program
1. You should have .NET 7.0 installed.
2. Expand start and select "Configure Startup Projects".
